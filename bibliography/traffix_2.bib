abstract = {In smart cities, when the real-time control of traffic lights is not possible, the global optimization of traffic-light programs (TLPs) requires the simulation of a traffic scenario (traffic flows across the whole city) that is estimated after collecting data from sensors at the street level. However, the highly dynamic traffic of a city means that no single traffic scenario is a precise representation of the real system, and the fitness of any candidate solution (traffic-light program) will vary when deployed on the city. Thus, ideal TLPs should not only have an optimized fitness, but also a high reliability, i.e., low fitness variance, against the uncertainties of the real-world. Earlier traffic-light optimization methods, e.g., based on genetic algorithms, often simulate a single traffic scenario, which neglects variance in the real-world, leading to TLPs not optimized for reliability. Our main contributions in this work are the following: (a) the analysis of the importance of reliable solutions for TLP optimization, even when all traffic scenarios are consistent with the real-world data and highly correlated; (b) the adaptation of irace, an iterated racing algorithm that is able to dynamically adjust the number of traffic scenarios required to evaluate the fitness of TLPs and their reliability; (c) the use of a large real-world case study for which real-time control is not possible and where data was obtained from sensors at the street level; and (d) a thorough analysis of solutions generated by means of irace, a Genetic Algorithm, a Differential Evolution, a Particle Swarm Optimization and a Random Search. This analysis shows that simple strategies that simulate multiple traffic scenarios are able to obtain optimized solutions with improved reliability; however, the best results are obtained by irace, among the algorithms evaluated.}
