abstract="An important phase of a wind farm design is solving the Wind Farm Layout Optimization Problem (WFLOP), which consists in optimally positioning the turbines within the wind farm so that the wake effects are minimized and therefore the expected power production maximized. Although this problem has been receiving increasing attention from the scientific community, the existing approaches do not completely respond to the needs of a wind farm developer, mainly because they do not address construction and logistical issues. This chapter describes the WFLOP, gives an overview on the existing work, and discusses the challenges that may be overcome by future research.",
